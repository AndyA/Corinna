=head1 NAME

Corinna::Stack - A Stack!

=head1 WARNING

This module is used internally by L<Corinna>. You do not normally know much
about this module to actually use L<Corinna>.  It is documented here for
completeness and for L<Corinna> developers. Do not count on the interface of
this module. It may change in any of the subsequent releases. You have been
warned. 

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Corinna::Stack;
  my $stack = Corinna::Stack->new();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Quite simple, really.  Just a stack implemented via an array.
 
This module is a blunt copy of the L<Data::Stack> module. I had originally intended to use that module
but it turns out that it -superflously- requires perl 5.8.6 to build and I only had perl 5.8.4 on my system
with no means to upgrade. So that's why I had to copy all the code in L<Data::Stack> into this otherwise needless module.

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new( [ @ITEMS ] )

Creates a new Corinna::Stack.  If passed an array, those items are added to the stack.

=item peek()

Returns the item at the top of the stack but does not remove it.

=item get($INDEX)

Returns the item at position $INDEX in the stack but does not remove it.  0 based.

=item count()

Returns the number of items in the stack.

=item empty()

Returns a true value if the stack is empty.  Returns a false value if not.

=item clear()

Completely clear the stack.

=item pop()

Removes the item at the top of the stack and returns it.

=item push($item)

Adds the item to the top of the stack.

=back

=head2 EXPORT

None by default.

=head1 SEE ALSO

There are various Stack packages out there but none of them seemed simple enough. Here we are!
